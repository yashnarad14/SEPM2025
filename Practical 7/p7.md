# 🔁 Modeling Sequence Diagrams – Inventory Management System

A **Sequence Diagram** is a type of UML diagram that shows how **objects interact over time** in a particular scenario. It captures the **sequence of messages** exchanged between different parts of the system for a specific functionality (use case).

---

## 📘 Purpose of Sequence Diagrams

- Visualize the flow of control and data
- Understand object interactions in detail
- Analyze system behavior under different scenarios
- Help developers identify object responsibilities and methods

---

## 🧩 Elements of a Sequence Diagram

### 1. **Object (Participant)**

- Represents an instance of a class involved in the interaction.
- Notation: Named as `objectName:ClassName`

**Example**:  
`shopkeeper:User`, `system:MLModel`

---

### 2. **Lifeline**

- A vertical dashed line that represents the object's presence over time.
- It starts when the object is created and ends when it is destroyed or the sequence ends.
- Used to show the timeline of messages and responses.

---

### 3. **Activation Box (Execution Specification)**

- A thin rectangle on a lifeline that shows when the object is **active** (executing a process).
- It represents a method call or an operation in execution.

---

### 4. **Messages**

- Horizontal arrows between lifelines that represent **communication** between objects.
- Types:
  - **Synchronous** (`→`) – Waits for a response (e.g., method call)
  - **Asynchronous** (`⇢`) – Does not wait for a response
  - **Return Messages** (`←`) – Dashed arrow returning data/result

## 📊 Sample Sequence Diagram - "Predict Stock Demand"

### 🎯 Use Case: Shopkeeper uses ML model to forecast demand

```text
Actor: Shopkeeper

shopkeeper:UI        → login()
UI:user              → authenticateUser()
user:UI              ← loginSuccess

shopkeeper:UI        → click "Predict Stock"
UI:MLModel           → fetchSalesData()
MLModel:SalesData    → getHistoricalData()
SalesData:MLModel    ← historicalData

MLModel              → predictDemand()
MLModel:UI           ← predictionResult

UI:shopkeeper        ← Display forecast
