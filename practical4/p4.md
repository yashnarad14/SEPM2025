# 🧩 UML Use Case Modeling & Use Case Scenarios

This section explains the importance and theory behind **UML Use Case Diagrams** and how **Use Case Scenarios** are captured for the **Inventory Management System** project.

## 📌 What is a Use Case Diagram?

A **Use Case Diagram** is a part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) used to visualize the **functional requirements** of a system. It shows how **actors** (users or external systems) interact with the system's **use cases** (functions or services).

### ✅ Purpose of a Use Case Diagram

- Identify and clarify system requirements
- Provide a high-level functional overview
- Act as a communication bridge between stakeholders and developers
- Help detect missing functionalities early in development

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Key Components

| Element       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Actors**    | External entities interacting with the system (e.g., Shopkeeper, Admin)     |
| **Use Cases** | Functions or actions the system performs (e.g., View Stock, Predict Demand) |
| **System**    | The boundary that defines the scope of the application                      |
| **Relationships** | Includes associations, extensions, and generalizations                  |

## 💡 Use Case Diagram – Example (For This Project)

**Actors**:
- Shopkeeper
- System Admin

**Use Cases**:
- Login
- View Inventory
- Predict Stock Demand
- Update Inventory
- View Sales Reports
- Add New Products
- Generate Analytics

📌 _Note: The visual UML diagram can be created using tools like Draw.io, Lucidchart, or StarUML._

## 📖 What are Use Case Scenarios?

A **Use Case Scenario** is a textual representation of how a user interacts with the system to achieve a specific goal. It includes all **possible flows** — basic, alternate, and exception flows.

### ✅ Why Use Case Scenarios?

- Define step-by-step system behavior
- Handle both normal and error conditions
- Help in writing test cases and documentation

---

## ✍️ Sample Use Case Scenario

### 🎯 Use Case: Predict Stock Demand

- **Actor**: Shopkeeper
- **Precondition**: Shopkeeper must be logged in
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Shopkeeper selects "Predict Stock" option.
  2. System fetches historical sales data.
  3. ML model runs prediction algorithm.
  4. System displays demand forecast for each product.
- **Alternate Flow**:
  - If data is insufficient, system shows an error message.
- **Postcondition**: Prediction results are shown and can be saved for reference.

## 📁 Tools for Modeling

- **Draw.io** – for creating UML diagrams
- **StarUML** or **Lucidchart** – for professional modeling
- **Markdown or Word** – for writing use case scenarios

## ✅ Conclusion

Modeling **UML Use Case Diagrams** and capturing **Use Case Scenarios** help ensure that the system aligns with user expectations and functions correctly. They are essential in bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders and guiding system development.
