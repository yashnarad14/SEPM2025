# ðŸ”„ Modeling: Data Flow Diagram (DFD) & Control Flow Diagram (CFD)

This section provides an overview of **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)** and **Control Flow Diagrams (CFD)**, their purpose, and how they relate to the **Inventory Management System** project.

## ðŸ“˜ What is a Data Flow Diagram (DFD)?

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** is a graphical representation used to show the **flow of data** through a system. It helps in visualizing how input data is transformed into output results through various processes.

### âœ… Purpose of DFD:

- Identify processes involved in the system
- Understand how data moves between system components
- Clarify input/output interactions
- Aid in system analysis and design

---

## ðŸ”° DFD Levels Used:

### 1. **Level 0 (Context Diagram)**

- Provides a high-level overview of the entire system
- Shows main system as a single process and its interaction with external entities

**Example Components**:
- **External Entities**: Shopkeeper, Admin
- **Main Process**: Inventory Management System
- **Data Flows**: Inventory Data, Predictions, Reports

### 2. **Level 1 DFD**

- Breaks down the main process into sub-processes like:
  - Data Collection
  - Stock Prediction
  - Inventory Update
  - Report Generation
- Shows data stores such as:
  - Sales Database
  - Product Inventory DB

ðŸ“Œ _You can draw DFDs using tools like Draw.io, Creately, or Lucidchart._

## ðŸ“– Sample Data Flow (Level 1):

**Processes**:
- P1: Collect Sales Data
- P2: Predict Demand using ML Model
- P3: Update Inventory
- P4: Generate Reports

**Data Stores**:
- D1: Sales History
- D2: Inventory Database

**Data Flows**:
- Shopkeeper inputs â†’ P1 â†’ D1  
- D1 â†’ P2 â†’ Forecast Output  
- Forecast Output + Admin Input â†’ P3 â†’ D2  
- D2 â†’ P4 â†’ Reports to Shopkeeper/Admin

## ðŸ”ƒ What is a Control Flow Diagram (CFD)?

A **Control Flow Diagram (CFD)** illustrates the flow of **control** (rather than data) through the system. It shows **execution logic**, **conditions**, and **sequences** between operations or modules.

### âœ… Purpose of CFD:

- Show logical sequence of system operations
- Represent decisions, loops, and parallel tasks
- Useful for understanding system behavior & logic

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Sample Control Flow (for "Predict Stock" Feature):

1. Start
2. User selects "Predict Stock"
3. System checks login status
4. IF authenticated:
   - Load historical data
   - Run ML prediction
   - Show predicted demand
5. ELSE:
   - Show login prompt
6. End

ðŸ“Œ You can draw this using flowchart symbols or tools like diagrams.net (Draw.io).

## ðŸ§  Differences: DFD vs CFD

| Feature         | DFD (Data Flow Diagram)                 | CFD (Control Flow Diagram)                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Focus           | Flow of data                             | Flow of control / logic                     |
| Shows           | Processes, data stores, and data paths   | Decisions, branches, loops, execution steps |
| Use             | Functional design & analysis             | Logic and behavioral understanding          |
| Diagram Style   | Bubble chart                             | Flowchart style                             |

## âœ… Conclusion

Modeling DFDs and CFDs helped in:

- Structuring the **Inventory Management System** logically
- Ensuring smooth **data movement and process control**
- Identifying dependencies and decision points early

These diagrams are critical for both **design documentation** and **project evaluation**.
