# COCOMO Estimation for Inventory Management System

This README provides a COCOMO-based effort estimation for the **Inventory Management System** project. The system uses machine learning and predictive analytics to optimize stock readiness by analyzing sales data, customer segmentation, and buying behavior.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Title**: Data-Driven Inventory Management System  
**Domain**: Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Inventory Optimization  
**Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Flask, SQL  
**Team Size**: 4 Members  
**Development Time**: Final Year Project (~4–5 months)  
**Estimated LOC**: ~5,000 lines of code

## 🔍 What is COCOMO?

COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is a software estimation model used to predict the effort, time, and resources required to develop software based on its size (measured in KLOC - thousand lines of code).

---

## 📐 COCOMO Model Used: **Basic Model**

The **Basic COCOMO model** classifies the project into one of three categories:

1. **Organic** – Simple projects with small teams and stable requirements.
2. **Semi-Detached** – Intermediate projects with mixed experience teams and moderately complex requirements.
3. **Embedded** – Complex systems with tight constraints and stringent requirements.

> **Our project falls under the _Semi-Detached_ category** because:
> - It uses ML & predictive analytics (moderate complexity).
> - Built by a small team with a mix of experience.
> - Has integrated data pipelines and user interface modules.

## 🧮 Basic COCOMO Formula

### Effort (Person-Months):
E = a × (KLOC)^b
D = c × (E)^d

### Semi-Detached Model Constants:
- a = 3.0
- b = 1.12
- c = 2.5
- d = 0.35

## 📊 COCOMO Calculation

### Step 1: Estimate KLOC
```text
KLOC = 5 (approx. 5,000 lines of code)

E = 3.0 × (5)^1.12 ≈ 3.0 × 5.56 ≈ 16.68 person-months
D = 2.5 × (16.68)^0.35 ≈ 2.5 × 2.74 ≈ 6.85 months
Team Size = Effort / Duration ≈ 16.68 / 6.85 ≈ ~2.4 people
