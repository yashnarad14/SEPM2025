# Software Testing for Inventory Management System

## Aim

To study and implement various software testing methodologies by designing effective unit, integration, and system-level test cases for the inventory management project in order to verify its functionality, detect bugs, and ensure quality.

## Theory

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application performs as expected. It helps identify bugs, ensure performance, and maintain software quality. Testing can be broadly classified into three levels:

- **Unit Testing**: Verifies individual components or functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Validates interactions between integrated components.
- **System Testing**: Tests the entire system's behavior and performance against requirements.

These levels of testing help ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the software.

## Test Suite Design

| Test Level        | Module/Component                     | Test Case Description                                             | Expected Output                                   | Status |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Unit Testing       | Demand Forecasting Algorithm         | Test output for specific historical sales input                   | Predicted demand matches expected values          | ✅     |
| Unit Testing       | Customer Segmentation                | Test clustering accuracy for sample customer data                 | Correct segments formed based on input patterns   | ✅     |
| Unit Testing       | Pricing Engine                       | Test price updates based on demand fluctuations                   | Updated prices match defined pricing strategy     | ✅     |
| Integration Testing| Forecasting + Inventory Update       | Ensure forecasted demand triggers correct inventory adjustments   | Inventory updated accurately for future demand    | ✅     |
| Integration Testing| Order Automation + Database Module   | Check if order placement writes correctly to the database         | Order records stored correctly                    | ✅     |
| System Testing     | Full Workflow                        | Simulate complete sales cycle with varying demand inputs          | System forecasts, updates, and automates orders   | ✅     |
| System Testing     | Edge Case – No Sales Data            | Test system behavior with empty or missing data                   | System handles gracefully with warnings/errors    | ✅     |
| System Testing     | Load Testing                         | Test performance under high data volume                           | Acceptable response time and no crashes           | ✅     |
